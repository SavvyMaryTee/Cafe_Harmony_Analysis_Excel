The idea of the project was to analyse Cafe Harmony. The company specializes in offering a variety of drinks, snacks, and light meals to customers over the past year, Café Harmony had seen impressive growth 
but now faces new challenges as the company is scaling to meet customer demand. The café had multiple locations across the city, each with its own performance metrics and unique customer preferences.
